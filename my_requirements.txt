Hindsight experience replay:

1. the goal (flag) is placed somewhere on the map
2. our agent goes on a trajectory to find it

3. after the episode ends (doesn't matter if the agent reaches the goal or not), some subset of states that the agent visited are chosen as pseudogoals
- accomplish this by doing the following:
    1. get the agent's global state at each time-step of the trajectory (use agent.get_loc())
    2. generate a new background map with the enemy flag moved to the next state the agent reached (s') when they took action a in state s
    3. reward the agent appropriately for reaching the flag
